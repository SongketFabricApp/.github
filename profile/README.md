Welcome Everyone!!

The Songket Fabric Recognition App represents an innovative application meticulously crafted to detect and identify songket fabrics within users' photographs. Our aim is to empower users by unraveling the fabric's name, motif, and providing a comprehensive description, thereby acting as a portal inviting individuals to immerse themselves deeper into Indonesian culture, specifically exploring the intricate realm of Indonesian songket fabrics. We envision that through our application, Indonesians will foster a heightened appreciation and profound understanding of their rich heritage.
